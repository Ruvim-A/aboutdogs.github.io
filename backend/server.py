        "description": "Alaskan Malamutes are powerful, wolf-like dogs bred by the Inuit people of Alaska to pull heavy sleds across long distances in harsh Arctic conditions, and they retain their incredible strength, endurance, and independent spirit that made them invaluable to their original owners. These large, fluffy dogs have thick double coats that protect them in temperatures as low as -20Â°F, but this same coat makes them prone to overheating in warm climates and requires daily brushing to manage shedding, especially during their twice-yearly 'blowout' periods when they shed their undercoat. Their strong pack instincts and high prey drive mean they may not get along well with small animals or strange dogs, and their intelligence combined with their independent nature can make them challenging to train, requiring experienced owners who can provide firm, consistent leadership and plenty of physical and mental stimulation to keep these powerful dogs happy and well-behaved.",
